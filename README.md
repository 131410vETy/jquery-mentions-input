jquery.mentionsInput
=================
jquery.mentionsInput is a small, but awesome UI component that allows you to "@mention" someone in a text message, just like you are used to on Facebook or Twitter.

This project is written by [Kenneth Auchenberg](http://kenneth.io), and started as an internal project at [Podio](http://podio.com), but has then been open sourced to give it a life in the community.
